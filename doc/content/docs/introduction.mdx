## What is Validation Box?

Validation Box is a **lightweight, zero-dependency, and fully TypeScript-based** validation library. Unlike traditional validation libraries, it gives you complete control over your validation logic by following a ```regex-first``` approach, allowing advanced customizations such as:

- Defining minimum and maximum length for inputs.
- Restricting banned words.
- Adjusting case sensitivity rules.
- Country-specific validation, ensuring that regional formats are correctly followed.

<Callout>Validation Box doesn’t impose rigid rules—it lets you define the validation rules that fit your project’s needs.</Callout>

## Comparisons

Validation Box was built with flexibility and simplicity in mind. While powerful libraries like Yup, Zod, and Joi exist, they often come with rigid schemas, heavier dependencies, or are optimized for specific environments. We don’t claim to be better than all of them, but we aim to provide a lightweight, regex-first approach that works across frontend, backend, and mobile applications with country-specific validation as a key differentiator.

If your project needs full control over validation logic, minimal dependencies, and adaptable validation rules, Validation Box might be the right tool for you.
