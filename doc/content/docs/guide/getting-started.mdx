## Basic Usage Example

Once installed, you can start using Validation Box right away. Here's a simple example of validating a username with custom rules:

First hand you need to do the import from the library and call the function you are using. [Here the list of options](https://vbox.euotiniel.com/docs/configuration/configuration).

```ts
import { validateUsername } from "validation-box";
```

Functions return ```true``` or ```false``` depending on the options. You need to create a function and pass the value that is then to the options.

```ts
import { validateUsername } from "validation-box";

const isValid = validateUsername("dev_otoniel", {
  minLength: 5,
  maxLength: 15,
  allowSpecialChars: "_-",
  bannedWords: ["admin", "root"]
});

console.log(isValid); // true or false
```

<Callout>The default validation rules apply if no options are provided.</Callout>
