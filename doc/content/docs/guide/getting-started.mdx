## Basic Usage Example

Once installed, you can start using Validation Box right away. Here's a simple example of validating a username with custom rules:

First hand you need to do the import from the library and call the function you are using. [Here the list of options](https://vbox.euotiniel.com/docs/configuration/configuration).

```ts
import { validateUsername } from "validation-box";
```

Instead of returning a simple boolean, functions now return an object containing valid and errors.

```ts
import { validateUsername } from "validation-box";
 
const result = validateUsername("dev_otoniel", {
  min: 5,
  max: 15,
  allowSpecialChars: "_-",
  bannedWords: ["admin", "root"],
  messages: {
    min: "Username must be at least 5 characters long.",
    max: "Username cannot exceed 15 characters.",
    bannedWords: "Username cannot contain restricted words.",
  }
});
 
console.log(result.valid);  // true or false
console.log(result.errors); // { username: ["Username must be at least 5 characters long."] }
```

<Callout>The default validation rules apply if no options are provided.</Callout>
